# An Analysis of Poverty and Education in California Public Schools

### Executive Summary
Discrepancies in the quality of education between public schools undermines the Department of
Educations’ mission to foster “educational excellence and ensur[e] equal access.” This analysis
sheds light on the relationship between student poverty levels, school resource access, and school
success. In California schools, fewer students qualifying for subsidized meals, schools having
more fully-qualified teachers, and schools meeting their annual learning targets all correlate with
one another. This correlation suggests that poorer students receive worse education than affluent
students on average. This analysis recommends further study to determine causality and
subsequent policy intervention as a remedy.

### Motivation
Public school education in the United States is often funded by property taxes of surrounding
areas. As a result, affluent neighborhoods tend to have better funded public schools. Well-funded
schools tend to do better than underfunded schools. This sequence of reasoning suggests that
children from affluent families (and thus neighborhoods) will receive a better education from
their public schools than children from poorer families, and would have wide-reaching
implications for education equity and policy. This paper will analyze California Schools
Academic Performance Index (API) data collected by the California Department of Education to
examine whether student poverty is correlated with a decrease in resources among public
schools. It will also examine these variables in relation to relative school success.

### Research Questions
1. Do schools with lower-income students have equal access to qualified teaching staff?
2. How do the rates of poverty among students and full qualifications among teachers
    correlate with schools’ ability to reach their learning improvement targets?

### Data
The California Schools API data provides various instruments at the school-level including:
1. The percentage of students who qualify for subsidized meals (i.e. students whose
household income is below 185% of the poverty line),
2. The percentage of teachers who are fully qualified (as opposed to emergency certified),
3. Whether a school met its school-wide growth target and comparable improvement target.
This paper will use the percentage of students qualifying for subsidized meals as a relative
indicator of a school’s affluence. It will use the percentage of teachers who are fully qualified as
an indicator for how well-resourced a school is. And lastly, it will estimate a school’s success
based on whether or not it met its annual targets.

### Hypothesis
This analysis hypothesizes that the percentage of students qualifying for subsidized meals
correlates with the qualification rates of the teachers. More generally, it predicts that schools
with poorer students have access to fewer resources on average.

### Analysis
This analysis shows with high confidence that low levels of student poverty and higher levels of fully-qualified
teachers predict school success among the greater population. This analysis shows that more
qualified schools (90% or more fully-qualified teachers) meet academic success targets more
often than less qualified schools (*p < .001*). More qualified sample schools meet targets at a rate
of 75.7% while less qualified sampled schools meet theirs 65.5% of the time (Figure 1).
With respect to student family income, higher income schools (less than 50% of students
qualifying for subsidized meals) in California meet academic success targets more often than
lower income schools (*p < .001*). While 73.2% of sampled higher income schools achieve their
targets, 68.8% of sampled lower income schools meet theirs (Figure 2).
Furthermore, California schools with fewer students qualifying for subsidized meals do indeed
have more fully-qualified teachers (*p < .001*). In other words, higher-income schools tend to be
more qualified. 72.2% of sampled higher-income schools had 90% or more fully-qualified
teachers as compared to 36.9% of lower-income schools (Figure 3).
This analysis shows the explicit link between (1) teacher qualification rates and school success,
(2) student income level and school success, and (3) student income level and teacher
qualification rates. These findings support the hypothesis that student family income and school
access to resources are not independent.

### Methods, Limitations, and Further Study
This analysis was conducted using standard Z-Tests to make use of the relatively large sample
size (*n = 6190*) in California School’s API data. While population means likely differ slightly
from the sample means above, the large sample size suggests relative stability in those means.
This analysis suffers from limitations in data and equity. While the indicators available are
helpful, they do not measure income or resource availability precisely and are estimates at best.
This analysis also did not account for race and--given that black and brown Americans tend to be
poorer--fails to provide information for a discussion regarding racially equitable education.
Additionally, this analysis does not define causal relationships between student family income,
school resource access, or school target achievement. Continued study would benefit from causal
analysis of these factors as well as disaggregation by racial and ethnic identities.

### Policy Implications
Policymakers seeking to improve school success should focus on the dynamic between student
poverty, school resources, and school success. First steps may include allocating funding for
schools to hire more fully-qualified teachers but, as noted above, further analyses will provide
more targeted direction.

### Conclusion
This analysis examines the relationship between loosely defined indicators of student family
income, school resource access, and school success. It shows within a 99% confidence interval
that schools serving low income students tend to perform worse, that schools with fewer
qualified teachers also tend to perform worse, and that lower income students more often attend
schools with less qualified teachers.
