# PUBPOL 527 - Quantitative Analysis I - Winter 2021

PUBPOL 527 is the first in a series of quantitative analysis courses at the Evans School. 527's memo assignments involve stata programming to analyze datasets, draw (limited) conclusions, assess confidence levels in those conclusions, discuss policy implications/limitations of the analysis, and provide visuals. 

Memos 1 and 2 are small, individual assignments with extremely limited scope and considerable overlap that explore the correlation between California public school's success rates, percent of students qualifiying for subsidized meals, and percent of teachers that are fully-qualified. 

The final memo was a group effort that analyzed ACS data from 2009 and 2019 to examine trends surrounding the time period of the ACAs implementation. Specifically we use Z-tests to determine with high confidence (p < 0.001) increases in healthcare coverage rates over time, and explore those changes as they relate to race and whether or not the participant's home state had implemented the ACAs Medicaid-expansion program.
